## Exercises

* **Recommended: Complete the first 16 exercises in the [ES6](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#es6) course on FreeCodeCamp**

  If you get through the **Basic JavaScript** exercises, start on these. In this class, I will be writing and sharing code that uses conventions in these exercises up through _Write Concise Object Literal Declarations Using Object Property Shorthand_ -- that's the first 16 exercises in the ES6 "course".
