## Starting the next project -- Build a Dashboard

Fork https://github.com/musa-6110-fall-2023/dashboard-project

1. I recommend for this coming week that everyone know the domain they want to create a dashboard within, what kind of decisions they want to support within that domain, and for what audience.
2. Further, spend some time listing out the information you want to surface through your dashboard, and what data you might need in order to surface that information (like we did on the board in class).
3. Finally, sketch out how you might want to lay out the lists, maps, graphs, and metrics on your dashboard for your users.

## Tips: Where to find geospatial data

We mentioned a few places in class:

- Local government open data catalogs are a great place to start when they exist (e.g. https://opendataphilly.org/Links to an external site.).
- State universities may have good resources for geospatial data (e.g. https://www.pasda.psu.edu/Links to an external site.).
- National data portals can be useful, particularly for complete sets of administrative boundaries, or census data (e.g. https://data.gov/)Links to an external site..
- For POI (point-of-interest) data, OSM is a good starting point for free data (the Overpass API is one good way to get access to OSM, e.g. through https://overpass-turbo.eu/),Links to an external site. but non-free sources like the Google Places APILinks to an external site. or the Foursquare APILinks to an external site. are often more complete and have additional data attributes like user reviews (even though these are technically non-free, they do have free tiers that are pretty easy to stay within; also note that these APIs are neither free as in beer, nor free as in speechLinks to an external site., which is to say there are limitations regarding the licensing of the data you get from them that may want to be aware of).
