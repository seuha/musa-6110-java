## Agenda

- Submitting your Story Map project
  - Follow the instructions at https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1744245/assignments/11667422
  - Remember, you only have to submit your pull request once, even if you change your code.
- Building a map visualization in JS
  - Our target is https://musa-6110-fall-2023.github.io/course-info/week04/demographics-dataviz-end/
  - Libraries we'll use
    - Leaflet for mapping
    - [csv-parse](https://csv.js.org/parse/) for CSV (though there are other popular ones, like [PapaParse](https://www.papaparse.com/))
    - Core JavaScript stuff (like `JSON` and `Math`)
  - Start from [this starting code](demographics-dataviz-start/)
- [Anatomy of a Web Request](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12F814zTAxTzUkuLVLd9bUL4zo8PPklq6QHJdmuQBNJw/edit?usp=sharing)

## Exercises

* **Complete another ~28 (or more) exercises in the [Basic JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-javascript) course on FreeCodeCamp**

  We should be through the entire Basic JavaScript section (113 exercises in all) by **next week**, so that comes out to around 28 exercises per week.

* **Extra: Complete the first 16 exercises in the [ES6](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#es6) course on FreeCodeCamp**

  If you get through the **Basic JavaScript** exercises, start on these. In this class, I will be writing and sharing code that uses conventions in these exercises up through _Write Concise Object Literal Declarations Using Object Property Shorthand_ -- that's the first 16 exercises in the ES6 "course".

## Resources

The following may come in handy while styling data on Leaflet maps:

* [Path Style Options](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html#path-option)
* [Creating Choropleth Maps](https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/) -- from the Leaflet Documentation
* [Using Custom Icons](https://leafletjs.com/examples/custom-icons/) -- from the Leaflet documentation
